	- I had to modify the script to give the make command twice,
    - in fact the first one gives an error in generating the documentation,
    - but if we give the command again then the compilation is successful.
    - Let me know if you have the same problem, and a possible solution. Thanks.

Hi Folks,
I am slowly regaining the ability to work on the repository.
It's going to take me a while to upgrade slackware,
fix everything and then compile pretty much the whole repository.
But something is moving.
Let me know if you know of any problems with new updates, patches, etc.
Thank you all, and please forgive the long absence. Happy Slack!
