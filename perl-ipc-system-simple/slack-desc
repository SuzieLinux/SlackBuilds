# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-ipc-system-simple:
perl-ipc-system-simple: Calling Perl's in-built 'system()' function is easy; determining if
perl-ipc-system-simple: it was successful is _hard_. Let's face it, '$?' isn't the nicest
perl-ipc-system-simple: variable in the world to play with, and even if you _do_ check it,
perl-ipc-system-simple: producing a well-formatted error string takes a lot of work.
perl-ipc-system-simple: 'IPC::System::Simple' takes the hard work out of calling external
perl-ipc-system-simple: commands.
